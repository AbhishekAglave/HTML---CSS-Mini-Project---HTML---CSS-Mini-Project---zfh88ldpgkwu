# html-css-project-boilerplate
I got this project idea from my friend's business. He sales custom backcovers of phones, printed t-shirts, mugs, pots, etc. as client needs.
So I tried this simple ui using html css only, I didn't used any bootstrap or any readymade code.
all that is written is all by only myself. 
I will also implement all the necessary featers to make this site working and live.

thank you...
